## Bring The Delorean Back To LiFi 
#### A Hack Western Project by Neil Chauhan, Zachary Mullins, and Nishil Patel

At the same time, the rise of autonomous vehicles will require this same data in order to navigate safely and optimally. We decided to develop a system targetting a logical method for these two worlds to communicate effectively, using a resource that is abundant in cities: lights.
